Try the live app out and do well to come back and leave a star on the repo if you like it. It can analyze any language that is available on google translate. But note that the results of the analysis will not have excellent human efficiency. They will be mechanical. The 'human-like' efficiency of the analysis depends on how explicit the syntax of the text you put in is. Explicit means whether your text has a clear subject, verb and predicate. Poorly formed sentences will be difficult for AI to analyze. But it will try it's best.
